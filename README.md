# Welcome!

I work on legal argumentation and rhetoric, with an interest in the history of legal and political ideas, and environmental ethics.

I am an associate professor at [Pázmány Péter Catholic University, Faculty of Law](https://jak.ppke.hu/en), Department of Legal Philosophy, and a senior research fellow at the [Centre for Social Sciences, Institute for Legal Studies](https://jog.tk.hu/en) (Budapest, HU), where I am PI of the research project _Legal Argumentation in the 21st Century_ (NKFI FK 138346).

I serve as editor of the journals [_Hungarian Journal of Legal Studies_](https://akjournals.com/view/journals/2052/2052-overview.xml) and [_Public Governance, Administration and Finances Law Review_](https://folyoirat.ludovika.hu/index.php/pgaf).
