# Welcome!

I work on legal argumentation and rhetoric, with an interest in the history of legal and political ideas, and environmental ethics.

I am an associate professor at Pázmány Péter Catholic University, Faculty of Law, Department of Legal Philosophy, and a senior research fellow at the Centre for Social Sciences, Institute for Legal Studies (Budapest, HU), where I am PI of the research project _Legal Argumentation in the 21st Century_ (NKFI FK 138346).

I serve as editor of the journals _Hungarian Journal of Legal Studies_ and _Public Governance, Administration and Finances._
